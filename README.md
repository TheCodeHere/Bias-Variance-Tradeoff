# Bias-Variance-Tradeoff
The bias-variance tradeoff, a fundamental concept in Machine Learning, tell us that the generalization (test) error, which is the error in unseen data, can be decomposed in bias error (error from wrong model assumptions), variance (error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in training data) and irreducible error (inherent noise in the problem itself).
